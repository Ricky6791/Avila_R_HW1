Structure of Program:
File organization: plants.cpp
Functional organization: Main() takes input of how many plants we start with
and then asks for the temperatures of the following 7 days and gives total sold at end of week

Status: It works completely

Hardware & platform I used: Intel core i7 with 16GB RAM MacOS

Compile: extract the archive and then from shell run "make". This will create executable hw1 and then run ./hw1
